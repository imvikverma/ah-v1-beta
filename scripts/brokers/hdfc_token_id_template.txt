# HDFC Sky Credentials Template
# 
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# Since the URL doesn't contain api_key and token_id, extract them from browser:
#
# METHOD 1: Browser Console (Easiest) - Based on React Code
# 1. Open Developer Tools (F12) → Console tab
# 2. Run these exact commands:
#    localStorage.getItem('api_key')
#    localStorage.getItem('token_id')
#    localStorage.getItem('accessToken')
# 3. Copy the values and paste them below
#
# METHOD 2: Application Tab
# 1. Open Developer Tools (F12) → Application tab
# 2. Check Local Storage → https://developer.hdfcsky.com
# 3. Look for api_key and token_id keys
#
# METHOD 3: Network Tab
# 1. Open Developer Tools (F12) → Network tab
# 2. Refresh page, check any API call's URL or headers
# 3. Look for ?api_key=...&token_id=... in request URL
#
# Once you have the values, paste them below:
#
# IMPORTANT: This file will be deleted after importing for security

# Option 1: Paste the COMPLETE URL here (if it has ?api_key=...&token_id=...)
URL=

# Option 2: Or paste the values directly here (from localStorage):
API_KEY=
TOKEN_ID=

# Optional: JWT token (from localStorage.accessToken) - for Authorization header
ACCESS_TOKEN=
