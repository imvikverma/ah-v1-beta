        "# AurumHarmony Frontend Design (Flutter)\n",
        "\n",
        "This document describes the **intended Flutter frontend** for AurumHarmony. It focuses on UX, navigation, and data flows, so implementation can be done later.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overall App Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "- Root: `AurumHarmonyApp`\n",

        "    - **Trade**\n",
        "    - **Reports**\n",
        "    - **Notifications**\n",
        "  - Admin functions exposed via a separate **Admin Panel** entry point or an “Admin” button visible only to admin users.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common elements:\n",
        "- Consistent color theme (dark/light toggle), with accent color matching brand.\n",

        "\n",
        "## 1. Project Scaffold\n",
        "\n",
        "- Flutter project named `aurum_harmony_frontend`.\n",

        "  - `lib/screens/` – individual screens.\n",
        "  - `lib/widgets/` – reusable UI components.\n",
        "  - `lib/services/` – REST API client for the backend.\n",
        "  - `lib/state/` – app‑wide state management (e.g., Riverpod/Provider).\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Dashboard Screen\n",
