# Documentation for AurumHarmony

This directory contains documentation for the AurumHarmony core backend:

- High‑level **architecture** and module overview.
- **Configuration** and environment variables.
- **Usage** notes for running the app and orchestrator safely.
- Pointers to backtesting and strategy code.

Key files:

- `CONFIGURATION.md` – Environment variables, risk limits, trading modes, Fabric config.
- `USAGE.md` – How to run the Flask app and orchestrator in a safe, mostly handsfree way.

Additional architecture/strategy/backtesting docs can be added here as the system evolves.
